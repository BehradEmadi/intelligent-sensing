This repository contains three Python scripts focused on the application of machine learning techniques to enhance the accuracy and intelligence of Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) systems using different types of sensors. The scripts demonstrate a progression from basic accuracy improvement to advanced condition assessment using deep learning architectures.

For a deeper understanding of each script and the methodologies behind them, the following references are highly recommended:
